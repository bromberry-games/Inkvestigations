	<p>
		Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether the use could be considered fair use. Fair use states that brief
		excerpts of copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim for purposes such as criticism, news reporting,
		teaching, and research, without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder. If you have considered fair use, and
		you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve
		the matter directly with the user.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys&#8217; fees incurred by us
		or our users, if you knowingly misrepresent that the material or activity is infringing. If you are unsure whether the material you are
		reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may, at our discretion or as required by law, share a copy of your notification or counter-notification with third parties. This may
		include sharing the information with the account holder engaged in the allegedly infringing activity or for publication. If you are
		concerned about your information being forwarded, you may wish to <a
			href="https://www.copyrighted.com/professional-takedowns"
			target="_blank">hire an agent</a
		> to report infringing material for you.
	</p>
	<h2 id="notifications-of-infringement">Notifications of infringement</h2>
	<p>
		If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any material available on our Services infringes your copyrights,
		then you may submit a written copyright infringement notification (&#8220;Notification&#8221;) using the contact details below pursuant
		to the DMCA by providing us with the following information:
	</p>

			Notification, you may provide a representative list of the copyrighted works that you claim have been infringed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Identification of the infringing material and information you claim is infringing (or the subject of infringing activity), including
			at a minimum, if applicable, the URL or URLs of the web pages where the allegedly infringing material may be found.
		</li>

			Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail
			address.

			owner, the copyright owner&#8217;s agent, or the law.

	</p>
	<p>
		Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and
		completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include the removal or restriction of access to
		allegedly infringing material as well as a permanent termination of repeat infringers&#8217; accounts.
	</p>
	<p>
		If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make

		full copy of your Notification (including your name, address, phone, and email address), along with instructions for filing a
		counter-notification.

			Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail
			address.

			mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or restricted.
		</li>

			infringement notification.
