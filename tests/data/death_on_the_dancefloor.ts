export const letter = `Dear Mr. Holmes,
a murder has occurred and I am writing you at the behest of prison governor Ernie Orion. A warden in Pentonville named Leonard Corcoran was found strangled in the visitor's room of the prison. We have already performed our routine investigations and determined the cause of death, interrogated several prisoners as well as the staff. We have narrowed it down to only two possible individuals. As impossible as it may seem, there are only two people not accounted for during part of the window where the murder occured. The first one is Heinrich Mann, a prisoner locked up for forging wills and unlawfully stealing estates from those to whom they rightfully should have passed. He was seen with Corcoran by the other prisoners when they were leaving for the yard. The second is the very same who called for you, Ernest Orion. He was not seen for part of that window. He claimed to have been on the toilet.

This is a personal matter to me in a way. Ernie is a good friend of mine and used to be the finest detective of Scotland Yard in his day. When he could no longer work as a detective they promoted him to govern the Ville. He is about to retire, and I see no way in which he could have done this. It would simply make no sense. I told him as much and was happy to put this whole thing to rest, but he insisted upon your intervention. 
Mr. Holmes, please do this favor to my wayward friend and colleague, but do not overthink it.

Of course, I will perform everything you say to the letter, for example:
- question Heinrich
- search the place of the murder
- inspect certain items

You can see the suspects' pictures in your notes next to your input window. I have also provided you with ample space to take notes next to their pictures. When you are ready, you can solve this case by tapping on "write" to change the input command to "solve" and make your case there. But be careful: to solve this mystery, your deduction must have the following:
- Motive
- Opportunity
- Evidence

Yours truly,
William Wellington`;
