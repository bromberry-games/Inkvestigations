Inkvestigations is a webgame using LLM technology (currently GPT) to create interactive mystery games. 

If you are a fan of the detective or mystery genre, interactive fiction games, or an LLM game enthusiast, this game is for you. It uses authored mysteries and combines it with the imagination of LLMs to create stories without invisible walls but with concrete solutions.

Inkvestigations is a website that offers crafted mysteries. You are Sherlock Holmes, corresponding with police chief Wellington through letters to help him solve cases that are too tough for him.  

It's not as simple as pasting a prompt into GPT-4. We're using langchain, chain-of-thought and other prompt gymnastics to achieve a great experience that works with GPT-3.5, which also makes it affordable to play. Inkvestigations started by us wanting to make a mystery game and thinking up cases while we were using ChatGPT. It simply never did exactly what we wanted it to do, so building solutions to problems we faced during play led made it into what it is today. Soon you will be able to add your own mysteries when we add the mystery creator, an interface that makes it easy to create cases for other Sherlocks to solve.
